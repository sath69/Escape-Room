FOR LOOP:
hmmmm im not very experienced with that as well
cant we just loop the answer list
yeah lets do it
the answers are in order so we dont need to worry
-loops through set 1 dictionary
    -loops through questions
        -displays each question

ye we could do that, or we could use enum to keep track of the index position
#actually, letsa try that

this is the error
im gonna workout how we lock the pinselectors so it doesnt loop back to that room
and also generate the pincode
#we can generate the random pin number on that function



ye we could do that, just list down all ur requirements:
